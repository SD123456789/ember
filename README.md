Ember is currently a tool written in Go that will query Cisco Firepower Management Center for a list of devices, then output a summarized list.

## Requirements:
To run it requires 3 environment variables to be set:
- FMC_HOST
- FMC_USER
- FMC_PASSWORD

Also the REST API needs to be enabled on FMC

## Usage:
Set the environment variables
Run the program

Binaries for windows, mac, and linux are available under the :*shocked face*: binaries folder.

## TODOs
- allow creds to be entered interactively
- unit tests
- additional features (shoot me some ideas or even better make a pull request)
